# Data Structures & Algorithms

Welcome to my personal repo for learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**!  
This repository documents my progress, thought process, and solutions to various problems from **LeetCode**, **CodeWars**, and other platforms — using **JavaScript** to solve them.

---

## About This Repository

This repo serves as my **learning log** — it's a place where I:
- Solve problems (as consistently as possible)
- Write clear **comments** explaining:
  - The problem statement from the platforms  
  - How I understood it  
  - My **thought process** and **approach**  
  - And finally, a link to the **original problem**

Each file in the folders represents a single problem from the platforms.


## Notes

Thanks for stopping by!  
This repository is not about perfection — it’s about **progress**.  
If you’re also on your DSA journey, feel free to **star** this repo and share your thoughts or ideas

- For learning im using [**Neetcode**](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) Roadmap for the path of my learning journey, Youtube && documentation.
- For practicing im using **LeetCode** && **CodeWars** ( *You can find my accountes down under in this readme file or my profile*)
